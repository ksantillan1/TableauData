Analysis

The stations with most start and end journeys Stations are Grove St PATH, 
Hamilton Park, Sip Ave, Newport PATH, Marin Light Rail, and City Hall, 
due to them being closed to the busiest places in the city and the most popular locations to visit.  
The least popular stations seem to be the ones away from the city center 
which makes sense since more people would use their own vehicles. 

People go to work and out around 8am and 6pm â€“ the rush hours. 
Which are the busiest times for the rides too. 
Therefore we can say that people use bike to go to work and back.


Summer and fall (June-November most specifically) are the most popular time of the year 
for rides. This makes sense since with a nice weather people are more likely to want be outdoors, 
and a bike ride y more appealing than a car ride.


Most customers are members, male between 25-40. While the ones with longer rides are males 19-22. 
There was an slight increase in the number of females to ride comparing the beginning and the end of the year.
